This project is more or less concentrated on my transcriptions of music as
I hear it and whatever crazy idea comes to my mind when transcribing that 
could sound cool in context. I use interval notation because I'm too lazy to
make sheet music and tabs. Plus music writen in interval notation can be very
easily transposed over the whole scale of an instrument with tempered tuning,
ie. fretted guitars.

For those that don't know what intervals are, please consider studying a little
bit of musical theory.
